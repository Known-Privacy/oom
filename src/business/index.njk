        <p class="mt-4 text-lg">Phishing is a type of social engineering where an attacker sends a fraudulent (e.g., spoofed, fake, or otherwise deceptive) message designed to trick a person into revealing sensitive information to the attacker.</p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-lg">Employees are increasingly targeted by using personal data that is available on the internet. The more data an attacker has about your employees, the more easily they may trick someone in your company.</p>
