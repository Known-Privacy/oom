"Data brokers do not obtain this data directly from consumers, and consumers are thus largely unaware that data brokers are collecting and using this information. While each data broker source may provide only a few data elements abouta consumer’s activities, data brokers can put all of these data elements together to form a more detailed composite of the consumer’s life."

\-FTC, 2014. "Data Brokers, A Call for Transparency and Accountability"

Sometimes when describing the nature of the Surveillance Economy, people say: 'really, is it a problem?'

We say: Don't take our word for it. Take it from the United States Government.

‍  
[The Federal Trade Commission published a report that describes the problem in great detail.](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/data-brokers-call-transparency-accountability-report-federal-trade-commission-may-2014/140527databrokerreport.pdf)

‍

Notice that this report was published in 2014. Yeah, 2014. Back then, we thought it might be a wake up call and that things might change.

The opposite happened. The problem has only gotten worse. In fact, the Data Broker industry has grown dramatically.

There are least a thousand of companies out there that you'd call a 'data broker'.

###### [Some estimate the data broker industry to be valued at over $250 Billion.](https://www.maximizemarketresearch.com/market-report/global-data-broker-market/55670/)

It's big business and a lot of money is being made off of our personal data. Shouldn't we be paid that money instead of the companies who spy on us for our data?

‍

Anyway, back to 2014.

Some selected parts of the report helps visualize what is going on.
