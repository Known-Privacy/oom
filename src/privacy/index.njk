                        <p class="leading-relaxed pb-4">We utilize <a class="underline" target="_blank" href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible Analytics</a> for marketing purposes on our website.

As stated by Plausible <a class="underline" target="_blank" href="https://plausible.io/data-policy">in their data policy</a>, the goal is to track overall trends in website traffic, it is not to track individual visitors.</p>
                        <p class="leading-relaxed pb-4">On subscription to our services, we ask you to complete an identity verification process. We also ask you to provide basic profile information.

                        <h2 class="mt-6 mb-4 text-lg font-semibold">How we store your data</h2>
                        <p class="leading-relaxed pb-4">Your data is encrypted both in transit (when traveling across the Internet or inside our system), and at rest (in our database and file stores). Our database encryption keys are rotated on a regular basis.</p>

                        <h2 class="mt-6 mb-4 text-lg font-semibold">Why Known Privacy can be trusted</h2>
                        <p class="leading-relaxed pb-4">At some level, you need to look at <a class="underline" target="_blank" href="{{'/about' | url }}">our "about us" page</a> and decide for yourself whether this is for real. To make our operation as trustworthy as possible, we endeavor to be as transparent and accountable as we can. We provide our names and links to our founder's backgrounds on LinkedIn. Our reputations are on the line. Known Privacy is a Public Benefit Corporation, a designation that legally forces us to behave with integrity. All of our operations, development and hosting are in the United States. And we minimize the use of third party services for business operations (such as chat, accounting, or CRM) with concern that customer information must not end up there.</p>

                        <h2 class="mt-6 mb-4 text-lg font-semibold">What we intend to enable by requesting a copy of your data from data brokers</h2>
                        <p class="leading-relaxed pb-4">With your permission, we may help you temporarily license your data to 3rd parties for a fee. We will share in the revenues created from those fees to you. Your agreement to the terms and conditions of any data license will be pre-requisite for any transaction to happen.</p>
                        <p class="leading-relaxed pb-4">We will provide complete transparency into any and all data that we have about you to you with our best effort. Our intent is total transparency.</p>
